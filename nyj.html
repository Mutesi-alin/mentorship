            <h3>Chapter 1: </h3> 
                Trevor Noah introduces us to the pre-apartheid landscape of South Africa,<br>
                 where Black South Africans were divided into tribes. The Zulu and Xhosa tribes had a long history of conflict.<br>
                 Trevor's mother, Patricia, was Xhosa, and her resilience and faith are evident throughout the book,<br>
                  including an anecdote about Trevor being thrown off a bus, which likely saved his life.,<br>
                <br>
               
                  
                  <br>
                  <br>
                Noah was born in 1984 to a single mother, Patricia, who defied the racist laws of apartheid by having <br>
                a child with a white Swiss immigrant, Robert. Despite the danger and social stigma associated with their <br>
                relationship, Robert never supported segregation and did what he could to undermine apartheid. Noah often <br>
                felt caught between racial groups, not light enough to be fully accepted into white culture and not dark <br>
                enough to be fully accepted into black culture.
                <br>

               <h3>Chapter 2: </h3> C
                Born a Crime Trevor Noah was born during apartheid, a time when sexual relationships between races were illegal.<br>
                 The Immorality Act of 1927 criminalized “illicit carnal intercourse” between people of different races. <br>
                Trevor’s mixed-race heritage—his mother Black (Xhosa) and his father white (Afrikaner)—made him a living testament,<br>
                 to the defiance of apartheid laws.

                <h3>  Connecting it with my Rwanda</h3>
                
                Connection to Rwanda While Rwanda’s history differs significantly from South Africa’s<br>
                There are parallels. Both countries have grappled with ethnic divisions, colonial legacies,<br>
,               And the struggle for identity.
                Rwanda experienced the devastating 1994 genocide, where ethnic,Tensions erupted into violence.<br>
.               Trevor’s account of apartheid-era South Africa reminds us to acknowledge our past, promote unity,
                 and learn from history.<br>
                 Rwanda’s journey toward reconciliation and healing serves as a powerful lesson for all nations.
